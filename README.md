# Covid-19 data visualization using pandas and matplotlib

As we all know about the dangerous world pandemic going on viz. 'COVID-19', I tried to visualize Covid-19 data using some graphs from matplotlib and using pandas.
The data is coming from- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/master/data/countries-aggregated.csv' which gets uploaded on daily basis.
In my small project, I have added below plots: 
1. Covid-19 Confirmed cases for 5 countries: UK, China, Spain, Italy, India.
2. India Death rate day-by-day.
3. India recovery rate day-by-day.
4. India recovery rate vs death rate.
5. Daily new cases in India.
